# RockPaperScissors_Game
This is a minor frontend project that I had created just for practice and fun.
Here I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the Rock Paper Scissors game in software version.

In this game a single user plays with the computer by clicking in their selected choice. The scores are updated during the course of the game. One can also reset the game to start again from beginning.
